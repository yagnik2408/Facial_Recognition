## 📌 Project Overview

Facial recognition plays a crucial role in healthcare, security, and biometrics. In this project, we simulate a real-world scenario by developing a CNN-based model that can accurately identify faces of individuals captured under different lighting, expressions, and conditions.

The model was built from scratch and fine-tuned to surpass **90% accuracy**.
